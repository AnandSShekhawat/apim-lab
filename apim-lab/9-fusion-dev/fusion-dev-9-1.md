# Exercise 8:  Fusion Dev(Read Only)

### Estimated Duration : 40 minutes

## Lab Overview

In this exercise, you'll create a Star Wars Fan Club mobile application using Power Apps and Azure API Management. You'll connect your member data from an Excel worksheet, integrate Star Wars character information through a custom connector, and customize the app to display favorite character details for each member.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: Power Apps and APIM
   - Task 1.1: Update CORS policy
   - Task 1.2: Create a custom connector
- Task 2: View your custom connector in Power Platform
- Task 3: Generate the Star Wars Fan Club Application
   - Task 3.1: Connect to the backing data source
- Task 4: Add Favorite Character information
   - Task 4.1: Add the Star Wars API Data Source
   - Task 4.2: Customize the generated app
   - Task 4.3: Add controls to the View Detail screen
   - Task 4.4: Connect the Detail Screen to the Star Wars API
   - Task 4.5: Show the Star Wars character information on the Detail Screen

## Task 1: Power Apps and APIM

The *premier* Star Wars Fan club is growing and the club officers would like to upgrade from their existing member tracking worksheet to a mobile application that would be available to their members all over the world. The members would also like to see information about their favorite Star Wars movies and characters in the application that would update as new shows and movies are released.

In this exercise, you will be using [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) with the Azure API Management instance that you created [in part three](../3-adding-apis/adding-apis-3-1-from-scratch.md) of this lab. The Excel worksheet of member profiles will serve as the primary backing data source and will be used to generate a base application. You will export the Star Wars API from Azure API Management as a Power Platform Custom Connector so that the Canvas App can access real-time Star Wars character information. For each of the Fan Club members, you can then search the Star Wars API character data and show information about their favorite character in the Canvas App.
