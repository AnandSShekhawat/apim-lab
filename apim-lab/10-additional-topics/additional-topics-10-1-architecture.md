- What type of APIs are you onboarding to Azure APIM?   
- What deployment model works for you (no vnet, internal, external)?  
- What tier of Azure API Management is the right for you?  
- What security will you add to your APIs? 
- What products are we going to define? 
- What teams and processes need to be in place to manage the Azure APIM?
