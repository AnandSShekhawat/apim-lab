## Excercise 9 : Advanced Architecture Features of Azure API Management

## Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, we will explore some of the advanced architecture features of Azure API Management (APIM). We will look at how to deploy a full API Management architecture including backend services, API proxies, and a self-hosted gateway.

## Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Architecture Design Session
- Task 2: Provision your own instance of ColoursWeb/ColoursAPI
    - Task 2.1: Deploying Web and API containers with Azure Container Instances
- Task 3: API Proxy to Serverless
    - Task 3.1: Azure Functions
    - Task 3.2: Azure Logic Apps
- Task 4: Self-hosted Gateway
    - Task 4.1: Deploy the Self-hosted Gateway
    - Task 4.2: Testing the API

## Task 1: Architecture Design Session (Read only)

In this task, we provide you with a template architecture diagram for your Azure API Management baseline architecture. We recommend you take the time and answer the following questions:

- What type of APIs are you onboarding to Azure APIM?   
- What deployment model works for you (no vnet, internal, external)?  
- What tier of Azure API Management is the right for you?  
- What security will you add to your APIs? 
- What products are we going to define? 
- What teams and processes need to be in place to manage the Azure APIM?
