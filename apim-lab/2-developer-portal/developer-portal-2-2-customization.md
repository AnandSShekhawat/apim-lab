### Task 4: Customizing the Developer Portal (Read-Only)

The Developer Portal is built on a customized [Paperbits Web framework](https://paperbits.io/) with Azure API Management enhancements (the fork resides in this repo - [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal)). You can self-host and tailor the portal referring to the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal/wiki) and [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-developer-portal). 

You can also learn to personalize layouts and styles from the document referenced [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize). A video on customization is also available, watch the [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mMtUSmfUlw).
