## Continuation for Exercise 5,Task 2: Revisions

### Task 2.1: Add a new revision

1. Go back to the Azure portal in the **API Management Service**, and select the **Star Wars** API **v2**.

1. Select the **Revisions** tab.

1. Add a new revision with the description `Adding a caching policy` and click on **Create**.

    > The new revision is online but not yet current. The previous revision continues to remain the active default. Having added the new revision has not resulted in any change for your API consumers.

### Task 2.2: Add caching

1. Switch to the **Design** tab, then select the `Get People` operation.
    > **Revision 2** automatically became the active revision you are now making changes in. You can also switch between revisions, but **be aware that changes to the *Current* revision are live immediately**.

1. Navigate to the **Inbound processing** tab.
   
1. Add a 10-second caching policy for the **GET People** operation via the Code editor.

    ```xml
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <cache-lookup vary-by-developer="false" vary-by-developer-groups="false" allow-private-response-caching="false" must-revalidate="false" downstream-caching-type="none" />
    </inbound>
    <backend>
        <base />
    </backend>
    <outbound>
        <base />
        <cache-store duration="10" />
    </outbound>
    ```
      ```
      <!--
      - Policies are applied in the order they appear.
      - Position <base/> inside a section to inherit policies from the outer scope.
      - Comments within policies are not preserved.
      -->
      <!-- Add policies as children to the <inbound>, <outbound>, <backend>, and <on-error> elements -->
      <policies>
      <!-- Throttle, authorize, validate, cache, or transform the requests -->
      <inbound>
            <base />
            <cache-lookup vary-by-developer="false" vary-by-developer-groups="false" allow-private-response-caching="false" must-revalidate="false" downstream-caching-type="none" />
      </inbound>
      <backend>
            <base />
      </backend>
      <outbound>
            <base />
            <cache-store duration="10" />
      </outbound>
      <on-error>
            <base />
      </on-error>
      </policies>
      ```



      ![APIM Created Revision](media/mapi50.png)

1. Once the code is updated, the new policy will be created.

### Task 2.3: Test the new revision

1. Navigate to the **Test** tab from the top.

1. From the Azure portal, select the `Get People` operation and click on **Trace**.
  
     > **Note**: The revision number at the top of the page as well as in the request URL. The request URL should look similar to: `https://<your-apim-name>.azure-api.net/sw/v2;rev=2/people/`.

      ![APIM Revision Caching Test](media/13.png)

1. Test the API twice. The test trace should then show that the cache lookup occurred.

### Task 2.4: Make current revision

1. Select the **Revisions** tab.
1. Click on the ellipsis for `rev2` and select the **Make Current** option.

      ![APIM Revision Make Current](media/15.png)

1. Check the **Post to the Public Change log for the API** and provide the description as `Adding a caching policy to improve API response time`. Click on **Save**.

      ![APIM Revision Make Current](media/16.png)

1. The new revision is now the current/live one. When you test now, note that the URL no longer contains a specific revision. The old revision is still online and can now be accessed with the `rev` qualifier. 

    > Unlike versioning, revisioning requires no URL updates for the API consumer.

### Summary
In this Task, a new revision is added to the Star Wars API in Azure API Management. This revision remains inactive until made current. Then, caching policies are applied to the GET operation of this new revision. Testing the API shows cache-lookup behavior. Finally, the new revision is made the current one, eliminating the need for URL updates for API consumers, illustrating the advantages of revisioning over versioning in APIM.
